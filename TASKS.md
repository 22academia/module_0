Each task needs to be completed inside their own folders/directories;
For example, the source-file  hello_world.c  is located inside the  hello_world  directory.

As the module progresses, you are required to create your own C 
source files in their respective directories.

Each directory has a "sample" program that shows you the expected result for that task. 
You can execute the sample program with the following:

---
    ./sample
---



###                     [  TESTING  ]


The module_* directory contains a test script named test_all.sh. You can run 
the following command to test all your tasks at once.

---
    ./test_all.sh 
---

Try running the command in terminal now. You'll see INCOMPLETE for
all of the tasks.

note ~ test_all.sh must be ran inside the module_* directory; where it is available.

Alternatively, each task has their own script named test.sh inside its directory. You can 
test each task individually as you work through the module.
