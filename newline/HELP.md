### Create a C file named newline.c using the touch command: [1]

---
	touch newline.c	
---

### Open the file with:

---
	open -a textEdit newline.c
---


###				TASK					[ TASK ]


Write a program that prints out 3 empty lines, followed by a w on its own line, 
then an 8 on its own line, then finally another empty line.

Tip ~  make sure there are no unnecessary spaces, since space is also a character.




### Compile your C file to produce an executable file with the following: [2]

---
	clang newline.c -o your_executable_file
---
Replace " your_executable_file " with anything you want.


### Run your C program with the following: [3]

---
	./your_executable_file
---



### Test your program with the following command: [4]

---
	./test.sh your_executable_file
---

note ~ test.sh accepts the executable file; NOT the C file. test.sh is just another program.



Continue to the next exercise once you pass.
~ navigate to the my_name directory using the terminal.
