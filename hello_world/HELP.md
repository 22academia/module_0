### Open the C file hello_world.c with the following command: [1] 

---
	open -a textEdit hello_world.c
---

note ~ textEdit is a default editor that comes with macOS.	



### Edit the file so that the program outputs the following: [2]

terminal
---	
Hello World!
---

note ~ run sample executable to see desired behaviour:

---
	./sample
---



### Compile your C file to produce an executable file with the following: [3]

---
	clang hello_world.c -o hello_world
---


### Run your C program with the following: [4]

---
	./hello_world
---



### Test your program with the following command: [5]

---
	./test.sh hello_world
---

note ~ test.sh accepts the executable file; NOT the C file. test.sh is just another program.



Continue to the next exercise once you pass.
~ navigate to the newline directory using the terminal.
